# Yum-assesment-2
The scope of this project is to develop an e-commerce website that focus opn food products.
The website frame has been changed from the original project in order to optimise nagivability and user interface for web platforms with wider screens rather than mobile platforms.
The core pages of the website will feature a list of products that will need to be added through nodes.
The website does contain a visible menu for each page in order to guarantee an easy navigation and allow the user to move around the page in an easy and smooth way.
